## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. *Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.*

    This means it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. 

2. *Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.*

     The main axis is the one set by `flex-direction` property. Flex items move as a group on the main axis. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, if the `lfec-direction` is row then the cross axis runs along the column.

3. *How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?*

    Flex items lay out as a row in default. A row runs in the direction that sentences flow in your writing mode and script description. If the direction do not match with your writing mode, it will cause problem to accessibility. For example, you are working in Arabic, which has a right-to-left script direction, the items should line up on the right.
